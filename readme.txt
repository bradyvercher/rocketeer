Bulk activate or deactivate Jetpack modules and view them in a standard list table format.

== Description ==

Requires [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/).

The list table format provides a better overview of available modules and the ability to bulk activate or deactivate modules is a vastly improved experience for anyone working with Jetpack on a semi-frequent basis.

Look for the Modules sub-menu under the Jetpack menu item after activating.

= Benefits =

* Easily toggle activation status with a single click.
* Bulk activate or deactivate modules.
* View all modules in an alphabetical list to quickly locate the one you're interested in.
* Filter modules by whether or not they're active, inactive, free, premium, available, or if they require a connection to WordPress.com
